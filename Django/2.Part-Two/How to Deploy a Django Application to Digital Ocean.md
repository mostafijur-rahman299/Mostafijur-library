## 12. [How to Deploy a Django Application to Digital Ocean](https://simpleisbetterthancomplex.com/tutorial/2016/10/14/how-to-deploy-to-digital-ocean.html) by Vitor Freitas.

#### or you can try it.

###### DigitalOcean is a Virtual Private Server (VPS) provider. In this tutorial I will guide you through the steps I go to deploy a Django application using 
* Ubuntu 16.04
* Git 
* PostgreSQL
* NGINX
* Supervisor
* Gunicorn

1. Go to: [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) then Sing Up & Login
```python
2. Create a New Droplet:

Pick the Ubuntu 16.04.1 distribution:
```
```python
3. Select the size of the Droplet (cloud server):

Like: $ 5/month or $ 10/month
```
```python
4. Select the region you want to deploy:

Like: New York or London
```
5. Finally pick a name for the Droplet & click on Create. After that you will see the recently created droplet in your profile:
```python
6. You will receive the root password via email. Now pick the IP Address and ssh into the server:
$ ssh root@107.170.28.172

* You will be asked to change the root password upon the first login.

* Also if you prefer, you can use the Digital Ocean’s console:
```
```python
7. Installing the Server Dependencies

* First thing let’s upgrade the packages:

$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get -y upgrade
```
```python
8. PostgreSQL

* Install the dependencies to use PostgreSQL with Python/Django:

$ sudo apt-get -y install build-essential libpq-dev python-dev

* Install the PostgreSQL Server:

$ sudo apt-get -y install postgresql postgresql-contrib
```
```python
9. NGINX

* Install NGINX, which will be used to serve static assets (css, js, images) and also 
to run the Django application behind a proxy server:

$ sudo apt-get -y install nginx
```
```python
10. Supervisor

* Supervisor will start the application server and manage it in case of server crash or restart:

$ sudo apt-get -y install supervisor

* Enable and start the Supervisor:

$ sudo systemctl enable supervisor

$ sudo systemctl start supervisor
```
```python
11. Python Virtualenv

* The Django application will be deployed inside a Python Virtualenv, 
for a better requirements management:

$ sudo apt-get -y install python-virtualenv
```
```python
12. Configure PostgreSQL Database

* Switch users:

$ su - postgres

* Create a database user and the application database:

$ createuser u_urban
$ createdb urban_prod --owner u_urban
$ psql -c "ALTER USER u_urban WITH PASSWORD '123'"

* PS: Make sure to pick a secure password! I’m using 123 for simplicity sake.

* We can now go back to the root user, simply exit:

$ exit
```
```python
13. Configure The Application User

* Create a new user with the command below:

$ adduser urban

* Usually I just use the application name. You will be asked a few questions.

* Add the user to the list of sudoers:

$ gpasswd -a urban sudo

* Switch to the recently created user:

$ su - urban
```
```python
14. Configure the Python Virtualenv

* At this point we are logged in with the urban user (or whatever named you selected). 
We will install our Django application in this user’s home directory /home/urban:

$ virtualenv .
$ source bin/activate

* Clone the repository:

$ git clone

* First open the urban-train directory:

$ cd urban-train

* Install the project’s dependencies:

$ pip install -r requirements.txt

* At this point you will need to set the database credentials in the settings.py file:

DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql_psycopg2',
        'NAME': 'urban_prod',
        'USER': 'u_urban',
        'PASSWORD': '123',
        'HOST': 'localhost',
        'PORT': '',
    }
}

* PS: There are better and secure ways to handle SECRET_KEY, database credentials etc. 
I’m editing it directly in the settings.py file for the sake of simplicity. 
The focus of this tutorial is on the deployment process itself.

* Migrate the database:

$ python manage.py migrate

* Collect the static files:

$ python manage.py collectstatic

* Test if everything is okay:

$ python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000

* Access the IP Address of your server using port 8000. In my case, 107.170.28.172:8000.

* This is just a test. We won’t be using the runserver to run our application. 
We will be using a proper application server to securely serve our application.

* Hit CONTROL-C to quit the development server and let’s keep moving forward.
```
```python
15. Configure Gunicorn

* First install Gunicorn inside the virtualenv:

$ pip install gunicorn

* Create a file named gunicorn_start inside the bin/ folder:

$ vim bin/gunicorn_start

* And add the following information and save it:

* /home/urban/bin/gunicorn_start

#!/bin/bash

NAME="urban_train"
DIR=/home/urban/urban-train
USER=urban
GROUP=urban
WORKERS=3
BIND=unix:/home/urban/run/gunicorn.sock
DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=urban_train.settings
DJANGO_WSGI_MODULE=urban_train.wsgi
LOG_LEVEL=error

cd $DIR
source ../bin/activate

export DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=$DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE
export PYTHONPATH=$DIR:$PYTHONPATH

exec ../bin/gunicorn ${DJANGO_WSGI_MODULE}:application \
  --name $NAME \
  --workers $WORKERS \
  --user=$USER \
  --group=$GROUP \
  --bind=$BIND \
  --log-level=$LOG_LEVEL \
  --log-file=-

* Make the gunicorn_start file is executable:

$ chmod u+x bin/gunicorn_start

* Create a directory named run, for the unix socket file:

$ mkdir run
```
```python
16. Configure Supervisor

* Create a folder named logs inside the virtualenv:

$ mkdir logs

* Create a file to be used to log the application errors:

$ touch logs/gunicorn-error.log

* Create a new Supervisor configuration file:

$ sudo vim /etc/supervisor/conf.d/urban-train.conf

* /etc/supervisor/conf.d/urban-train.conf

[program:urban-train]
command=/home/urban/bin/gunicorn_start
user=urban
autostart=true
autorestart=true
redirect_stderr=true
stdout_logfile=/home/urban/logs/gunicorn-error.log

* Reread Supervisor configuration files and make the new program available:

$ sudo supervisorctl reread
$ sudo supervisorctl update

* Check the status:

$ sudo supervisorctl status urban-train
$ urban-train                      RUNNING   pid 23381, uptime 0:00:15

* Now you can control your application using Supervisor. If you want to update the 
source code of your application with a new version, you can pull the code from 
GitHub and then restart the process:

$ sudo supervisorctl restart urban-train

* Where urban-train will be the name of your application.
```
```python
17. Configure NGINX

* Add a new configuration file named urban inside /etc/nginx/sites-available/:

$ sudo vim /etc/nginx/sites-available/urban-train

* /etc/nginx/sites-available/urban-train

upstream app_server {
    server unix:/home/urban/run/gunicorn.sock fail_timeout=0;
}

server {
    listen 80;

    # add here the ip address of your server
    # or a domain pointing to that ip (like example.com or www.example.com)
    server_name 107.170.28.172;

    keepalive_timeout 5;
    client_max_body_size 4G;

    access_log /home/urban/logs/nginx-access.log;
    error_log /home/urban/logs/nginx-error.log;

    location /static/ {
        alias /home/urban/static/;
    }

    # checks for static file, if not found proxy to app
    location / {
        try_files $uri @proxy_to_app;
    }

    location @proxy_to_app {
      proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
      proxy_set_header Host $http_host;
      proxy_redirect off;
      proxy_pass http://app_server;
    }
}

* Create a symbolic link to the sites-enabled dir:

$ sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/urban-train /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/urban-train

* Remove NGINX default website:

$ sudo rm /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default


* Restart NGINX:

$ sudo service nginx restart
```
```python
18. The Final Test

* Alright! At this point your application should be up and running! Open the web browser and access it:

* A final test I like to run is rebooting the machine and see if everything restarts automatically:
```python
$ sudo reboot

* Wait a few seconds. Access the website via browser. If it loads normally, 
means everything is working as expected! All the process are starting automatically.
```
```python
19. Updating the Application

* Usually that’s the process you will follow when you want to update your Django application:

$ ssh urban@107.170.28.172

$ source bin/activate
$ cd urban-train
$ git pull origin master
$ python manage.py collectstatic
$ python manage.py migrate
$ sudo supervisorctl restart urban-train
$ exit
```
```python
20. Caveats

* I just wanted to take you through the basic steps of a deployment using Digital Ocean.
 Actually, for the most part the basic steps will be the same for pretty much every cloud provider.

* Please note that there are lots of details regarding security, performance, 
how you should manage the sensitive data of your application, SSL certificate installation and so on.

* I highly recommend reading all the available documentation about deployment on the
 official Django Docs. Also it’s very important to learn about the tooling 
 you are using. Gunicorn, NGINX, Ubuntu, Supervisor, etc.
